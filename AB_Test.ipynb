    "**Unit of randomization:** User.  \n",
    "- Each person (user) is the thing we flip a coin for. Some users get the new experience (treatment), some keep the old one (control). We don’t randomize sessions or orders — we randomize users.\n",

    "**Treatment vs Control:** Users are randomly assigned to `treatment` or `control`.\n",
    "- Treatment = the new thing you want to test (e.g., a new promo or booking flow). Control = the current thing. Random assignment means users are put into groups by chance so the groups are comparable.\n",

    "cancel_rate_7d = (# users who cancel within 7 days) / (# users in cohort)\n",
    "- If 1000 users try the product and 100 of them cancel within 7 days, the cancel rate is 100 / 1,000 = 0.10 = 10%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null / Alternative hypotheses:**  \n",
    "1. H0: μ_treatment = μ_control (no change)\n",
    "- The default assumption is that the new change does nothing; the cancel rate in treatment is the same as in control.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. H1: μ_treatment ≠ μ_control (two-sided)\n",
    "- The alternative idea is that the change does make the cancel rate different (could be higher or lower). We’re testing for any difference first. If you only care about decreases, you could test one-sided, but two-sided is more conservative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If control has 10% cancel rate, H0 says treatment will also have 10%; H1 says treatment could be 9% or 11% — either would be a difference.\n",

    "**Statistical parameters / choices**  \n",
    "1. Baseline (control) cancellation rate: **p₁ = 0.10 (10%)** — chosen from historical estimates / industry benchmark.\n",

    "2. Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE): **Δ = 0.028 (2.8 percentage points absolute)** — smallest practically meaningful reduction we want to detect.\n",
    "- This is the smallest real change we care about. If cancellations drop by 2.8 points (e.g., from 10% to 7.2%), we think that’s worth acting on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Significance level (α): **0.05** (95% confidence).\n",
    "- We’re okay with a 5% chance of wrongly thinking the change worked when it didn’t (false alarm).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Power: **0.80** (80% chance of detecting the MDE if it exists).  \n",
    "- If the true effect is at least the MDE, we want an 80% chance that our test will find it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Test: two-sample proportions z-test (two-sided).\n",
    "- The math test we’ll use compares two percentages (cancel rates) and tells us whether the observed difference could plausibly be due to random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why these choices?**  \n",
    "- Baseline reflects observed historical cancel rate (or a conservative estimate if historical data is noisy).  \n",
    "- MDE is chosen to reflect a business-meaningful change — small enough to be valuable, large enough to be measurable given resource constraints.  \n",
    "- Two-sided test is conservative; if you only care about reductions, you could use a one-sided test (note this lowers required sample size)."
